Mountaineer? *Mountaineer* where the devil are they, mound, mount... mountain...
a mountaineer: ‘two men skilled in climbing mountains’. Jolly good, well you’re
in. Congratulations, both of you.

We’ll be leaving on January 22nd and taking the following routes. The A23s
through Purleys down on the main roads near Purbrights avoiding Leatherheads and
then taking the A231s entering Rottingdeans from the North. From Rottingdeans we
go through Africa to Nairobis.  We take the South road out of Nairobis for about
twelve miles and then ask.
