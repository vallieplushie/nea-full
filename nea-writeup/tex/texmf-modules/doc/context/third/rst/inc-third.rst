Third Chapter
=============
You are hereby charged that on the 28th day of May 1970, you did wilfully,
unlawfully, and with malice aforethought publish an alleged English-Hungarian
phrasebook with intent to cause a breach of the peace. How do you plead?

Not guilty.

I quote an example. The Hungarian phrase meaning ‘Can you direct me to the
station?’ is translated by the English phrase, ‘Please fondle my bum’.

I wish to plead incompetence.
