ConTeXt module to create T-Accounts

To use the module you could use the two predefined environment
'TACCOUNT' and 'TKONTO' or you could define your own with
the command \defineACCOUNT.

The background is drawn from TeX but it is possible to draw
a more fancy layout with MetaPost, the module itself comes
with the style 'account' you could use as a example for your
own graphic.

The module is copyrighted by Wolfgang Schuster and publishes
